Grammars Across Time Analyzed (GATA) is a resource that contributes to the understanding of language evolution based on the independent coding of two (or more) grammatical descriptions of the same language separated by more than 25 years. We assembled a sample of grammars which were selected if there was an accessible published grammar no older than 1990, if there is an accessible published grammar of the same grammar 25 years older (at least) than the newer grammar and if the languages were chosen evenly so to provide a balanced perspective across the world. These conditions were implemented in a search engine, which was run over Glottolog 4.4. data (glottolog current version link [here] (https://glottolog.org/))

We selected 31 grammatical features divided into six typological domains: grammatical relations, nominal categories, phonology, pronominal system, verbal categories and word order.

This is a first version of GATA which includes 52 languages, mostly currently obsolescing, coded in two time periods. GATA will continue growing in the next years.
